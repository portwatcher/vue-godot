         *    
         *  **[code skip-lint]Object.connect()` or [code skip-lint]Signal.connect()`?**  
         *  As seen above, the recommended method to connect signals is not [method Object.connect].

         *    
         *  While all options have the same outcome (`button`'s [signal BaseButton.button_down] signal will be connected to `_on_button_down`), **option 3** offers the best validation: it will print a compile-time error if either the `button_down` [Signal] or the `_on_button_down` [Callable] are not defined. On the other hand, **option 2** only relies on string names and will only be able to validate either names at runtime: it will print a runtime error if `"button_down"` doesn't correspond to a signal, or if `"_on_button_down"` is not a registered method in the object `self`. The main reason for using options 1, 2, or 4 would be if you actually need to use strings (e.g. to connect signals programmatically based on strings read from a configuration file). Otherwise, option 3 is the recommended (and fastest) method.  
         *  **Binding and passing parameters:**  
         *  The syntax to bind parameters is through [method Callable.bind], which returns a copy of the [Callable] with its parameters bound.  
         *  When calling [method emit_signal] or [method Signal.emit], the signal parameters can be also passed. The examples below show the relationship between these signal parameters and bound parameters.
